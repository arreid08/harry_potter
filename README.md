# Harry Potter Zone

![](https://www.potterapi.com/)
^ me coding this week!

## Project Description

This website was built to be a place to learn all about Harry Potter.  You can learn about the key characters, the houses and common spells.  You can also try your hand at the sorting hat to see which house you would be place in if you were a wizard.

## Project Links

## Wireframes

- [Initial Wireframe](https://res.cloudinary.com/john-deere/image/upload/v1578321821/wireframe1_kifapa.jpg)
	- this is my initial thinking of how I want my page to work.
<!-- - [react architecture]() -->

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add a place to save your favorite characters or spells.
- Log which house the user was placed in even if the page refreshes.

## Time Frames
<!-- 
Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evaluate game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize. -->

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Create all initial files and initial React setup | H | 4hrs|  |  |
| Connect to API and show it responding | H | 4hrs|  |  |
| Develop code for each component | H | 16hrs|  |  |
| Stylize the app | H | 5hrs|  |  |
| Work on final documentation | H | 3hrs|  |  |
| Total | H | 32hrs|  |  |
